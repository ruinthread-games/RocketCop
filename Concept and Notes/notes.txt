From meeting:

Map layout notes:
-place smaller buildings between larger fighting arenas
-possibly populate some of these with smaller mobs or more sparse enemies
-larger arenas located on massive skyscrapers might have scaffolding that functions as platforming element

Weapon / equipment notes:
-grenade launcher should have a magazine, 5-6 rounds, and require reloading - but has an infinite ammo reserve pool (can always reload)
-jetpack should have limited fuel, est. 5-10 seconds burst time, with perhaps 3 - 5 seconds recharge time

Voice notes:
-enemy should play cue for when spotting the PC
-PC will 'respond' to these under certain conditions; if the fight is just beginning, and possibly on random occurances throughout battle
-enemy should play cues for dying from weaponry, and also dying when falling (different lines)
-PC might play a cue for when he dies too

Reload animation notes:
-grenade launcher should have very basic arm motion for reload anim
